        </div>
        <div class="raw-content">Excellent instinct — you're correct, and you're starting to see one of the real truths of *your* specific numbers.

Let’s pull this apart carefully for a minute.

---

### Your PV budget (simplified baseline)

| Category | Estimate (USD) | In CAD (~1.37) |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Rent | ~$2,200 USD | ~$3,000 CAD |
| Utilities/Internet | Included or ~$100 USD | ~$137 CAD |
| Health (private) | ~$200 USD | ~$275 CAD |
| Groceries | ~$600 USD | ~$825 CAD |
| Dining out | ~$300 USD | ~$410 CAD |
| Uber / transport | ~$100 USD | ~$137 CAD |
| Misc (subscriptions, gym, etc) | ~$300 USD | ~$410 CAD |
| Travel / extra | ~$300 USD | ~$410 CAD |
| **Total** | ~$4,100 USD | ~$5,600 CAD |

---

### Comparison to Toronto

| Category | PV (CAD) | Toronto (CAD) |
| -------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Rent | $3,000 | $3,425 |
| Core cost of living | ~$2,600 | ~$2,800 |
| **Total** | ~$5,600 | ~$6,250 |

---

### Key takeaway

- **Toronto is only about ~$600–700 CAD/month more** for a similar quality of life, based on your numbers.
- That’s mostly driven by:  
   - Rent being a bit higher  
   - Higher cell/data plan  
   - Higher insurance / health costs (at least for the first few months pre-OHIP)
- Many other items (groceries, dining out, transport if you don't drive) aren't that different between PV and Toronto at your personal consumption level.
- You’re not spending wildly in either location. You're basically buying “comfortable urban expat life” in both.

---

### The *real* price difference kicks in if:
- You bought property (Toronto becomes much more expensive)
- You live very lean (PV gives you more flexibility to drop to $3,500 USD or lower if you wanted)
- You scale up lifestyle (Toronto can burn $10K/month if you want it to)

---

👉 **The hidden variable is the emotional one: what city feeds you better.**

In pure budget terms, for you, *Toronto vs PV is remarkably close.*

---

If you want, we can now model:

- **Annual cash burn** for both.
- **Sustainability against your current NW and work plans.**
- **"Runway" in each case.**

Shall I run those numbers? That’s where it gets really clarifying.</div>
