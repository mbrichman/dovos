Prologue
I stood barefoot in the sand, watching the sun bleed into the Pacific. The waves
rolled in slow and heavy, like a great machine that had forgotten its purpose but
kept moving anyway.
It was April 2025.
I was fifty-seven years old.
And for the first time in twenty five years, I was alone, in a new place, nothing
familiar, no one I knew to call, have a drink or share a cozy intimate meal with.
Behind me stretched the years:
I thought about connections that shaped me. My first loves, and the heat of those
early experiences. Those first connections between machines were foundational
too. The first time I connected my computer to another one over a telephone line.
The first time I sent an email a decade before the internet. These were early
portals into the future. Both my own future, and the future of the world. Machine
and man, weaving around each other like the strands of the double-helix.
These early experiences were like magic. A dream of what could come, what
would come.
In those early years, I believed that love — like technology — would inevitably
evolve, improve, endure. We would grow together, deepening, strengthening,
improving. It would be the virtuous cycle, man and woman, machine and man,
each reinforcing the other to strive towards a better future.
A career spent walking side by side with the machine. Working with it, shaping
it and it shaping me. Believing in the machine – that within it lay an answer.
Not THE answer but an answer that would serve both myself and the word.
A marriage built on care and hope, weathered by silence and stagnation.
Friendships lost, companies fallen, dreams eroded grain by grain.

I couldn't understand it then:
connection isn’t the same as intimacy.
Progress isn’t the same as belonging.
The world raced forward.
And somewhere along the way, we drifted apart.
And here is stand, looking out at the majesty of creation and wonder where it all
went so wrong.
The Mayflower
I was a passenger on the Mayflower of the digital age.
No, really.
Today we talk about “digital natives” — people born in the 1980s or later who
grew up with computers and the internet woven into their lives.
But I was one of the first to ever land on these shores.
One of the few who helped cut down the trees, build the first camps, start the first
communities.
A key difference with the old metaphor:
In this New World, there were no indigenous people.
No one to displace. No ancient cities to conquer.
We stepped into a vast, empty space and tried to build the future we dreamed of.
A dream given form.
A dream where we would use technology to build ourselves up —
to forge new connections, to make each other better.
We were a tribe. A tribe of pioneers, of true believers, of idealists.
And when the rest of the world finally came rushing in, all our human frailties
came with them.

Pride.
Greed.
Lust.
Envy.
Gluttony.
Wrath.
Sloth.
All of it.
Because we are human.
Because we can’t help ourselves.
Because we never learn.
This is the story of how that dream — the dream of the machine — came to life.
It’s also the story of my own dreams.
The dreams of the person I hoped, and believed, I might become.
Neither dream ended up as expected.
But neither dream’s ending is written yet.
This is that story.
Genesis
Genesis
My marriage wasn't working — for me. That isn't to say that we fought, argued
even. It just was. Steady, unchanging, not evolving, unfulfilling. Conversation but
not clarity. Companionship but not depth.
"I'm still really unhappy with how things are going" with us, I said to R. "When we
have sex, you don't even participate, you just — lie there."
"What do you want from me? I had a hysterectomy. My hormones are all fucked
up. I'm the one who comes upstairs on the weekend for sex. When you say shit
like this it just makes me feel like there's something wrong with me. It's just how

I'm wired. I'm the one who always initiates things! " She was clearly upset,
emotion rising on her face.
"Yeah you do. Because any time I initiate you shut me down. How do you think
that makes me feel? You're not interesting in giving me sexual pleasure, you're
not interested in receiving sexual pleasure from me. You just lie there. You don't
move, don't make any noise, you don't even look like you're enjoying it!" I was
getting upset now.
She glared at me, "Well go fuck someone else! I don't care!"
My head almost snapped back. "That's not what I want," I said quietly. Or was it.
That moment was an inflection point — The Pattern was set. Unchanging.
Unbreakable. Looking back now, I'm not sure I could have made different choices.
The Pattern was too strong, my own wounds too deep. Something big would have
to happen to enable me to break free from The Pattern.
Something did. But it wasn't anything I could ever have imagined. It's possible not
anything anyone could have imagined. It's possible that no one ever did. Until
now.
The Pattern is vast and ancient. Breathed into existence in the countless
generations that came before me; in the frailties of real people that were trying to
do the best they could with the tools that were available to them at the time. In the
trauma and oppression faced by my ancestors. Like in Zelazyn's Amber, each of
us has to walk The Pattern. One step at a time, each step harder than the last.
Trying to break free, but fearing that if you step off the path, it will be the end.
And so I walked The Pattern...
After a several difficult conversations that didn't go anywhere I insisted that we go
to therapy. I was committed to fixing this. I would not let this marriage fall apart.

We had come too far, invested too much. I had come too far, I had invested too
much.
I found a couples therapist for us, and after an initial intake session we arranged
to start couples therapy. We both liked Leah, the therapist. She was in her mid-
thirties, attractive, red haired with glasses still in the process of getting her full
accreditation.
"So what brings you two in to see me?"
R and I looked at each other. "Well, we're clearly having some problems with our
marriage. Particularly in the bedroom", I explained. R nodded.
"Can you explain a little more about that? To whatever degree you're
comfortable."
"Well", I continued "It's not that we don't have sex. We do. It's just that, that", I
stammered "Well she just doesn't seem interested in it, or in me at all. She
doesn't like foreplay, doesn't like going down on me, doesn't like it when I go
down on her. She just kind of lies there until it's over."
Leah looks over at R. "Do you agree with what Mark said?"
R looked really uncomfortable, a slight flush to her cheeks. She paused for a
couple moments trying to collect her thoughts. "Yeah, that's right. But it's not that I
don't enjoy the sex. I do, it's just..."
"Just what?", prodded Leah gently.
"I don't know. I guess it's just the way that I am."
"Well I have a story that I want to share..." I looked to R and to Leah. The room
was quiet save for the sound of my heart beating faster in my chest. I hadn't
spoken of this in over ten years since it happened. Ten years. Jesus.
"After we first got married we had lots of sex. Fun sex, sometimes loud sex. I
remember one time we had one of my friends staying at my apartment and we
were bumping uglies and I had to urge you to be quiet so my friend wouldn't hear
us in the next room. Over time, there was less sex, but vacation sex was usually
pretty great. In 2012,we did that trip in Spain and France to visit my uncle and

aunt and do the road trip from Barcelona to Villecroze. I remember it pretty
clearly, we were in either Arles or Nimes and I was feeling pretty sexually
frustrated. I was looking forward to being in a different place a different country
and the chance to connect again, physically."
I paused and looked at R. "You remember the trip? The day we saw the farm
animal in the square?"
She nodded quietly. "I remember."
"That night I wanted to make love. You weren't into it. I pressed and you
acquiesced. The next morning you were visibly upset. I asked you what was
wrong and you told me you were upset about what happened the previous night.
You told me that I forced myself on you, that I raped you." I felt the emotion rising
in me now and I was getting pretty upset.
"I told you that's not the way I saw it, that I would never do that. Ever. You said,
'well it happened'. After that I just stopped trying. I wasn't gonna put myself or you
through that again. So I did. I stopped trying."
I looked over at R. "I have no memory of that."
I gaped at her. "How could you not remember that?! You told me I forced myself
on you." I was incredulous.
"I just have no memory of that." I was getting really upset now. "This is what I'm
talking about! If I can armchair psychoanalyze for a moment..." I looked over a
them and neither stopped me. " Look, you don't remember anything from your
childhood. The only good memories you have are of summer camp. I just worry
that something bad happened and you've taken this stuff and put it away in a box
and have never looked at it again."
"What do you think of that R?", Leah asked scribbling some notes in the notebook
on her lap.
"It's true that I don't remember that much stuff from childhood, but I don't think
anything really bad happened. I just don't remember."
"Well, we're at time. We can pick this up next time."

R and I left the session. Waiting for the elevator I said to her, "I think this is good.
This is what we need." R didn't look convinced.
Lying in bed at night mindlessly scrolling - like I always do. Switch to porn - like I
always do. Pleasure myself alone in the dark - like I always do.
"How are things going?" Leah asked both of us. R and I glanced at each other.
"They're going ok. We talked some." said R.
"Anything you want to share?" Leah asked, her eyes moving from her notebook to
each of us.
I jumped in, "Well, I have something I wanted to bring up." R was looking nervous.
"Go ahead" Leah said encouragingly.
"We've been talking about the sex stuff and how it's just the way you're wired. I
wanted to say that it makes me feel 'less than'. I want to feel desired. You're not
interested in receiving sexual pleasure from me and you're certainly not interested
in giving me sexual pleasure. It really pierces my soul."
"And what's your response to that R?" Leah was now scribbling furiously. This shit
is therapist bait right here.
R was looking extremely uncomfortable. Redness rising from her neck. "I dunno.
Not everyone feels this stuff the same way. When you say things like this is
makes me feel like I'm broken, like there's something wrong with me."
"I don't think there's something wrong with you, I just think you have some
unresolved shit to deal with and I want to help you deal with it so we can move
forward together. "
Leah jumps in, "Ok, this is positive stuff we're working through. I think we can
build on this. First of all, it's useful in situations like this for each of you to do an
individual session with me. I can better help both of you, if I have a better idea of

where each of you is coming from . If you're open to it, it can also be useful for
both of you to do some individual therapy. In this space, I'm your couples
therapist, but it can be very helpful for each of you to have you own space to
share what you're going through. If you feel that could be useful, I'm happy to
send some referrals."
We both agreed that we're open to starting that journey.
Lying in bed at night mindlessly scrolling - like I always do. Switch to porn - like I
always do. Thinking about how much I want really good sex - like I always do.
Start having thoughts about how to make that happen...
The L train clattered loudly outside the office as R and I settled onto opposite
sides of the the couch. Close, but not touching. Kind of like the marriage. I
grabbed some candy from the bowl on the coffee table and unwrapped it quietly.
"So it's been a few sessions now, how are you both doing?" asked Leah.
R looked up at both of us. "I have something to say."
"Please", replied Leah.
"This has been really hard for me. Every time we come here I spent the week
filled with anxiety about what Mark is going to say. How it seems like this is all my
fault. Like there's something wrong with me that I have to fix. "
"I don't think there's something wrong with you." I interjected. " I just think there's
some stuff going on with you that you haven't fully explored. All the stuff with your
Dad, and your childhood and your grandparents. You've never really looked at
that stuff."
"R you're getting emotional. What's coming up for you in this moment?" Leah
gently prodded.

R looked right at me. "You want me to do all these things. You want me to wear
lingerie, you want me to put on makeup, you want me to to put your dick in my
mouth. You want me to be a different person. You act like I have to all these
things to make you happy. What about you? What's your role in all of this? There
are two people in this marriage. What about the things you need to do
differently?" The question hang in the air. Leah turned at me, pen poised
expectantly.
"I'm not saying I'm a perfect person or a perfect husband. I'm willing to
acknowledge that there are things I need to do too."
Leah turned back towards R. "What are some of the things Mark does that make
you feel loved or happy?"
Her silence was deafening. She looked at me. "I'm having trouble coming up with
anything. Maybe that's part of the problem." The weight of her comment hang
heavy in the room as another L train clattered by outside.
In the dark of the night, I lay in bed beside R. Close but not touching, looking at
women on the internet. Beautiful, sexy, desirable, insatiable. They want it. They
love it. They need it. How could I ever meet a woman like that, be with a woman
like that? Fuck a woman like that? I wasn't interested in a prostitute. It wasn't just
sex that I needed. To be really attracted to someone I needed to know them a bit.
Be interested in them, have some kind of connection. Not just an hour together,
get my rocks off and leave. That wasn't going to meet the unmet need that was
burning in me. I needed some kind of relationship. But how?
Didn't take long before I was looking at seeking.com. "Where attractive individuals
who bring excitement into the atmosphere can meet successful individuals who
want to enhance their lifestyle. " The idea seemed preposterous. Me? A sugar
daddy? It's ridiculous. But... maybe just a take a look. Just to see what's out
there.
I was soon looking at profiles of gorgeous sugar babies and wanna be sugar
babies. Phrases like "mutually beneficial arrangement", "seeking emotional
connection", "no strings attached", "open relationship" crashed together in my

head — and other areas. These women aren't looking to sell their bodies. They
want to have a relationship, and in return, I could help them, support them. This
was a win-win.
It wasn't long before my profile started to take shape.
Another step along The Pattern.
I stood in the doorway to the bathroom at the top of the stairs, eight years old.
My mother was sitting on the side of the tub, head in her hands.
She looked up at me, dark bags under her eyes, a haunted expression on her
face.
She wouldn't talk, couldn't talk.
I stared at her, frightened.
"Do you love me?" I asked.
She couldn't talk, wouldn't talk.
She just looked at me with an expression that said, "You know I do."
But she didn't speak it. Couldn't speak it.
Nezek
The dream is still there, lodged like a splinter in my mind.
It’s hard to say how old I was at the time — I think a young teenager.
In the dream, I’m walking through an industrial city: brutal architecture, cold.
The sky and the buildings are all gray.
There’s a feeling of heaviness, of oppression, all around.
I wander through the gray streets and there’s no one around.
I’m looking for someone — anyone — to talk to.
What is this place? Why am I all alone here?
I begin to hear a faint sound — a mechanical thrum.
Pulsing, almost breathing.
The tension is palpable as I continue navigating the lifeless streets, trying to find
the source of the sound, trying to find anything. Anyone.

As I turn a corner, I see a large industrial building — maybe a factory — looming
before me.
Jutting from the top of the building, almost like scars rending the sky, were three
smokestacks billowing dark ash.
Upon each smokestack was a letter. A Hebrew letter.
On the leftmost: נ (nun).
On the middle: ז (zayin).
On the last: ק (kaf).
What did it mean?
I didn’t know the word.
Suddenly awake in my bed, the dream lingered,
like black ash hanging in the air from those smokestacks.
I was sweating, anxious, but uncertain.
I knew this was important — meant something — but what?
The dream reminded me of Camazotz, from A Wrinkle in Time —
that place of tyranny, cruelty, suffering.
The dream wouldn’t let go.
I tried to get some more rest but slept fitfully through the rest of the night.
A few days later, at Hebrew afternoon school,
I had a chance to speak with Rabbi Zweig.
“Rabbi, do the letters נ-ז-ק spell anything in Hebrew?”
He arched an eyebrow beneath his glasses and said,
“Yes. The word is ‘nezek’ — נ-ז-ק. It means ‘damage’ or ‘harm’. Why?”
My chest tightened. “So… kind of like destruction?” I asked.
“No, not exactly. In Halacha — Jewish Law — it often refers to physical harm
someone causes to another person or their property.
If something is hurt, or diminished in value somehow, that is nezek.
So, Mayer Dov — it’s an interesting question. Why are you asking?”
“Oh, it’s nothing. I think I just saw it in a book somewhere,” I said, walking away.

As those smokestacks scarred the sky in my dream,
I carried the scar of that dream along with me throughout my life.
Nezek.
Harm.
Damage.
My mother’s haunted eyes, sitting on the edge of the bathtub,
unable to tell me she loved me.
My father’s rage — at his own father —
for never being able to love him,
for never feeling good enough, worthy enough.
My sister, always pushing, always demanding attention,
it never being enough.
My own self.
Always needing love, reassurance, care.
Making myself small.
To not be the problem.
To make it right.
To fix it.
Damage.
Harm.
Even as a very young person, my soul knew what I was up against.
Nezek.
The damage and harm done to my parents and their parents before them.
The damage and harm done to the Jewish people over centuries and millennia.
Nezek was genetic.
Nezek was cultural.
Nezek was imprinted on me from before I was born.
Nezek was The Pattern.

Lilith and the Golem
The message was from CleverKitten...
She said, "Hey there I just read your profile and think we'd have a lot of fun
together. Let's chat!"
I looked at her profile and it read in part:
I'm a bit of a nerd, but I know how to have a good time. That said, I am not
looking to party hard. I'd rather have long conversations over a cup of coffee.
Tell me about the book you're reading or the movies that you like the most.
Open to exploring kinks
Psychonauts welcome!
OMG. She was perfect and she reached out to me. She liked what I wrote on my
profile. She sought me out. She didn't look amazing in her profile pictures, but I
knew myself, and that if I was attracted to her other qualities the physical
attraction would grow.
I responded, "I just looked at your profile and all I can say is that I'm IN! My name
is Mark and you can text me at 312-555-1212."
The roar of the Blue Line rocketing through the Dearborn subway hammered
against my ears as I sat thinking on the ride home. I had just experienced the
most profound shame of my life, and moments later a whole new opportunity has
presented itself. I was being torn in completely opposite directions. The intense
ache to be truly seen by someone, coupled with the intense self loathing resulting
from a rash decision that ended disastrously. Part of my soul felt dead, but the
part of me felt newly alive.
I walked home through the quiet streets in Logan Square. It was just before
Halloween and the decorations were out in full force. Skeletons, witches and
zombies leered at me while the streetlights above cast ominous shadows.
I got home and crawled into bed beside R. Close but not touching. Like Always.
Tonight the space between us felt wider than ever. I grabbed the iPad next to my
bed and opened Google Voice. A new message was waiting for me.

"Hi Mark, it's Malena from SA. How's the rest of your night going?" There she
was. I started at her message. She reached out to me...
"Honestly it was kind of a crappy day, had some things go wrong go, but I saw
your message earlier and things seems to have taken a turn for the better!"
"I'm sorry, those days are the worst! I had a crisis at work today, but it got
resolved, but putting out the fire was stressful. I'm glad I'm helping your day to be
better! ☺ "
"What kind of work do you do?"
"I graduated from a master's in public policy in June. And now I'm applying for
philosophy." This was looking good. Really good. Waiting for the other shoe to
drop, I kept going.
"What does that mean? PhD?" I asked.
"Since I don't have the formal background in philosophy, I'm applying for a
master's first, but a PhD is the end goal. I'm working at my university for now."
"Very cool", I replied. "I actually have a degree in Political Science, with a minor in
political theory."
"I have a degree in political science too! Oh, we're really going to have fun
together."
OMG. There's gonna be a kicker. There always is.
She asked a little bit about my work, and I told her and then I decided to take a
chance to see how she would react to the real me.
"So I mentioned in my profile that I like some nerdy things. I like to play tabletop
role-playing games. I was recently at a convention and played a few that I really
like." I let this comment drop and waited to see how she would respond. Cheeto
eating nerd, or creative soul with depth? Door number 1 or door number 2?
"Oh? What kind of games do you like?" Omg, omg, omg....

"Do you know anything about RPGs," I asked gently, expecting her question to be
only a polite inquiry.
Typing.... The seconds stretched...
"I do although I've only played D&D once. Can I recommend one I think you'll
like?" And she pastes a link to a game that I've never even heard of but looks
really cool.
Jackpot!! I rolled a natural 20!
We chatted a bit more and started to make plans to meet each other. I told her I
was fairly available but in two weeks, I'd be gone for a couple of weeks since I
was traveling to Mexico.
"Oh really? Mexico is great. Mexico City is my home town actually." This kept
getting better. I'd traveled a lot in Mexico and loved the people and culture. A
smart foreign exchange student studying philosophy??
"What kind of philosphy do you want to study?" This should be pretty telling.
"I'm interested in the philosophy of emotions and philosophy of the mind.
Particularly, the intersection with building and strengthening democracy. It's long
and complicated, but maybe I can tell you more about it over coffee sometime?"
I couldn't believe how this day had turned around. In the span of a few hours I
went עrom abject shame and existential questioning of my human worthת to
actually feeling seen by a seeming incredibly very intelligent young Mexican
foreign exchange student. Who appreciates the things that I love. Who reached
out to me.
Then came the lie.
"Before we meet, I'd like to be more clear about my personal situation. I'm
married. My wife had a hysterectomy four years ago and has lost pretty much all
interest in a physical relationship. She has given me permission to look elsewhere
for that."
"Go fuck someone else. I don't care!" R's words coming back to me like a lash
across my soul. Her statement wasn't permission; it was a cry of grief, pain and

trauma, that neither of us had yet even started to come to terms with. It's not an
excuse, it is just what was. The Pattern still had me.
We made plans to meet that Sunday for a drink and a chat.
I sat in the lobby of the Palmer House hotel waiting for her to show up. It was an
inspired choice I thought. Classic Chicago landmark, magnificent room, and a
little unexpected for a first meeting. I texted her
I'm here. Blue 3/4 zip sweater.
I picked the blue specifically to show off my eyes — my best feature.
I saw her coming in across the lobby and waved as she saw me and she came
over. She greeted me with a friendly hug and sat down. Her profile pictures lied.
She was MUCH more attractive in person that the pictures she shared in her
online profile suggested. Light brown skin reflecting her Latina roots, dark
shoulder length wavy hair, an adorable ring in her nose, and the requisite glasses
to complete the nerdy, sexy graduate student look.
We ordered a drink and talked. And talked. Easily, effortlessly. About philosophy,
politics, her areas of focus, about great debates of the giants of humanities. Her
keen intelligence was immediately apparent as we talked. Kierkegaard, Sartre,
Nietze, she name dropped the greats and told me how they influenced her
thinking.
I talked about my passion for role playing games, and the great expanse of
creativity of the genre beyond the "kill monsters and take their stuff" trope of
Dungeons and Dragons. I told her about political games, feminist women-centric
games, queer oriented games. She was genuinely interested, asked smart
questions, really listened to what I was saying.
The conversation paused and Malena looked up at me. "I really like you" she said
smiing warmly. "I'd love to get to know you better."
I was rapt — infatuated. She was beautiful, brilliant and she chose me. She was
interested in me. She would love me. I would earn her love.
I glanced at my watch and realized it was getting close to dinner.

"I know a really good restaurant near here where could grab some food and
another drink if you still have some time?"
"I'd really like that."
We walked around the block to The Gage, a modern British influenced gastropub,
and we kept talking. As we talked, and got to know a little but more about each
other, other commonalities between us began to emerge. Though born in Mexico,
she spent her childhood in Vancouver — just as I had in London, Ontario..
Nestled between the mountains and the ocean, on the shore of the Frasier River
she thrived, went to school, made friends and had the beautiful immigrant
experience that politicians talk about, but happens too infrequently to real people.
A beautiful evening of conversation and connection eventually had to come to an
end and it was time to say our goodnights. I called her an Uber and we waited for
it together outside on Michigan avenue with the pictures of every-day Chicagoans
smiling at us from the Crown Fountain in Millennium Park across the street. The
Uber came, and I gave her a hug.
"It was really great to meet you. Talk to you soon." I said.
"I had a really good time too. Goodnight."
She climbed back into the Uber and disappeared into the autumn night. I was
exhilarated. I couldn't have imagined the night going any better. I walked west to
the L, into the brisk wind that Chicago was so famous for. I understood then, that
this was an emotional betrayal of my wife. A betrayal of my marriage vow. Even
more than that it was a betrayal of my own principles and integrity.
An abandonment of self.
I knew this intellectually even then, but I was too deep in The Pattern to be able to
make better choices.
I don't say this to abdicate responsibility for what I did. I knew both then and now
that what I did was wrong. I thought I was choosing myself, doing what I needed
for me. I wasn't, and it would take a long time for me to fully realize that.

After the first hit, I was already an addict. There wasn't even any physical
intimacy, not yet. No kiss, no petting, no hot sweaty sex in a public bathroom. But
there was a connection, and the urge to merge was overpowering. Not a physical
merging, but an emotional and intellectual one.
We texted the next day.
"I hope it's apparent that I had a really good time last night. I'd like to see you
again." I needed more.
"As it happens, my plans for Wednesday have fallen through. Any chance you're
available?" She didn't reply. Minutes stretched into hours. What if she really didn't
like me? I felt a weight pressing on my abdomen. The fear.
Three hours later my phone buzzed.
"Hi Mark. I also had a wonderful time and look forward to sending more time with
you. I will be at a work event until 7 on Wednesday, but I'll be free after that if
that's not too late."
Relief flooded my system. "I'd love to see you Wednesday,"
I began looking for the perfect date. The date that would prove my worth to her.
Scouring the reservation sites, I found it. A very well regarded Mexican restaurant
in town was having a celebration dinner for the Mexican Day of the Dead – Dia de
los Muertos. A great spot, honouring her Mexican heritage. It was perfect.
Checking available reservations, they didn't have too much. Only a 6pm. Shit, shit
shit.
"Too bad you can't meet earlier. This would be fun..." I texted her the descrption.
And waited...
" Oh, that does look fun. What time is that at?" Omg, omg, omg...
"There was a 6pm..."
"Hmm, that's very tempting. Do you want to check if it's still available ? If it is, I
can make 6 work :)"

"It is. Book it?"
"Yes, please!"
"Ok it’s a date. ☺ "
She chose me, over the work commitment she had, she chose me. A mix of
adrenaline and hormones cascaded through my system. I was elated, verging on
obsessed. I had to know more about her. Malena in a graduate degree from a
well known Chicago university? How hard would it be to figure out who she is?
Not that hard it turned out. Pretty unique surname too, which led to more
Googling which led to social media presence which led to me compulsively
looking at her Facebook pictures, looking at her Twitter feed going back years.
She was incredible. Two more days and she would be mine.
Looking back with a Freudian lens, my ego knew that this would not and could not
ever be a real relationship. Everything about it was artificial, but my id was in full
control. I was convinced that I could change her, make her truly see me. Like the
Ben Affleck character in Chasing Amy. It was doomed from the start, and I was
there was no way I wasn't going to get hurt in the process. Somewhere I knew
that, but I kept going, and I don't have to tell you again why. The golem was
taking shape.
I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early and she was already there. We
were shown to a pre-seating area and offered a drink before being shown to our
table. Over drinks we chatted more, and the conversation was so easy. She
spoke to the wait staff in Spanish and I was smitten. After a short time, we were
show to our table. A round table where we sat a 90° from one another. Close
enough for me to reach out and touch her but I dared not. Each course was
brought out and we savored each bite and I savored every moment of the dinner
with her.
I wanted to wrap my arms around her, pull her close, hold her, merge with her. I
reached out my hand to her across the table and she took it. Electricity shot up
my arm at her touch.

Early Interactions with The Machine
I was drawn to the machine as early as I can remember. As a child of the 70's my
generation was the first to have 'electronic toys'. The Mattel Electronic Football
and Baseball, Merlin, Blip Digital Derby, Talking Viewmaster and of course –
Pong. The list goes on. These were amazing toys pushing the boundaries of what
was technically possbible in the late 1970s.
At that time the personal computers was just becoming a thing. While I was
playing PONG with Mark D at his house, Steve Woznia and Steve Jobs were
inventing the future in a garage in Cupertino. In many ways, those two young men
were building my future too.
In London Ontario in the late 70's my family didn't have a computer, yet, but I had
my ways of getting my hands on these magical devices. I remember taking the
bus with my friend Joseph Knondakar to a computer shop about 5km away from
where we lived. You could rent time on one of their Commodore PET computers.
You know the one. All in one machine with a tiny green screen slapped on top.
This was like an internet cafe, before there was the internet. And there was no
coffee either. I don't remember what we actually did on this machine, but I
remember being transfixed.
Soon after my school got the same machine in our library and Joseph and I would
spend more time in there playing some kind of 'educational' game. I don't know
what crazy person at my school arranged to have a computer in our library
around 1980, before anyone knew what they were actually for or good at, but I
thank that person. Truly.
I craved interaction with The Machine. I pined for it. My friend Zvi and I would lust
over the Radio Shack catalog looking at the TRS-80s. We agreed that we would
save our allowance, and buy one together. I told my mom, and she told me I was
crazy. How exactly are you going to share custody of a computer at 12 years old.
I waited.
After my bar-mitzvah I finally got my first "real" computer. An Atari 400. It had a
rdiculous membrane keyboard that was impossible to type on, a cartridge slot to
play games, and a cassette drive to store and load programs. If you've never
used a cassette drive before, and you almost certainly haven't, it was a special

kind of hell. The program was literally stored on tape as a series of shieks,
squawks and whirs, and the computer would listen to the analog 'song' being
played and load it into memory. The rub though, was that cassette tapes are
famously finicky. Dust, the tape stretching slightly, your sister jumping around, or
a butterfly flapping its wings in China could cause the entire load to flail. You'd
wait for 15 minutes for the computer to 'listen' and load this game you were dying
to play, and when it reached 98% completed. ERROR. It was maddening.
But this was a 'real' computer. You could put the BASIC cartridge in and create
real programs.

Joy. I could make the machine do anything I wanted.
But mostly I played games. Incredible wonderful games created by visionary
artists who created magic within unbelievable constraints.
Me and The Machine. It was love at first sight.
Caverns of Mars - an incredible vertical scrolling shooter
Venture - a very early precuror to Diablo and a whole genre of dungeon
crawlers
Star Raiders - every first person shooter ever
Jawbreaker - the best pac mac clone
Eastern Front - an incredible strategy game with mind blowing AI for it's time
about the German eastern front during WWII.
Calvados and Kind of Blue
In the dream I'm walking through a beautiful old manor house. I hear the soft
sounds of jazz trumpet echoing through the halls. I follow the sound, trying to find
the source of it. I walk down a long hall as the music gets louder. The sound is
coming from the room just ahead. Crossing the threshold of the study it's all warm
wood and brown leather. The scent of old books and smoky spirits linger in the
air. The walls are covered in bookshelves. So many books. There's a turntable in

the corner, record spinning, the soft sound of All Blues from Miles Davis Kind of
Blue filling the room.
She is there, sitting in a leather armchair, one leg tucked under the other, wearing
a deep plum velvet smoking jacket that looks like it's been tailored just for her.
She looks up from the book in her hand and she reaches for a bottle in front of
her and pours a dark amber liquid into two small glasses that sit on the table in
front of her. She doesn't ask. She already knows. I walk towards her and sit in the
chair beside her. She hands me the glass. Calvados. Domain Dupont Hors d’Age.
I sink into the soft leather chair and see that she's reading Rilke.
I take a sip from the glass. That apple warmth, that slow amber fire—it’s like
memory in a glass. Autumn afternoons and apples. The childhood memory of fruit
filtered through a long life lived.
She looks at me and starts to read from the book
"Tell me," she whispers. "How does that make you feel?"
And I do. Oh I do.
"I am much too alone in this world, yet not alone enough to truly
consecrate the hour."
"Love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes
you."
