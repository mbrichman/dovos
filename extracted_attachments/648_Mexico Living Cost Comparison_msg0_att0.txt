Real talk - will it be cheaper to have the same quality of life in PV va chicago vs Toronto



**ChatGPT** *(on Jun 15, 05:23 AM)*:

Real talk? Yes — and I’ll break it down very plainly for you:


### If we’re talking about:


> 
> "Same quality of life" = same housing comfort, safety, food quality, healthcare access, ability to live well, eat out, enjoy life, not live lean, not sacrifice comfort.
> 


### PV vs Chicago:


- Housing: Much cheaper in PV — even very good quality long-term rentals (Colonial, say) will run you ~40–60% of Chicago equivalents.
- Healthcare: Cheaper out of pocket in PV. No insurance bureaucracy, better private pay options. You can afford excellent care for a fraction of US premiums.
- Food: Groceries are cheaper if you shop locally. Imported goods can be pricey, but dining out is vastly cheaper for quality.
- Utilities / Services: Cheaper overall, though electricity can be high if you're running A/C a lot.
- Lifestyle: You get better weather, more walkability (depending on where you are), and lower daily cost of indulgences (coffee, meals, etc).


→ **Overall: PV is ~30–50% cheaper for the same lifestyle comfort.**



### PV vs Toronto:


- Housing: PV is still cheaper, but the gap is narrower depending on where in Toronto. A comfortable long-term rental in PV may cost you $1500–2500 USD equivalent, while Toronto might be $2500–4000+ CAD for comparable quality.
- Healthcare: Canada wins because of universal coverage, but private care wait times can be long. In PV, your private out-of-pocket care is often better/faster but not "free." Still, total annual costs likely similar.
- Food: Groceries and eating out are much cheaper in PV. Toronto food prices have gotten insane.
- Taxes: Canada is way higher — income tax, property tax, sales tax. PV is very favorable on total tax burden.
- Cost of Living Inflation: Toronto is vulnerable to Canadian inflation, PV's inflation is present but often manageable if you're income-sovereign.


→ **Overall: PV is ~20–35% cheaper than Toronto for the same quality of life.**



### The truth:


- Chicago → PV: big savings
- Toronto → PV: moderate savings
- PV gives you the best overall "comfort per dollar" if you're income-sovereign.



👉 If you want, I can run a few actual model scenarios for you based on:
- your current budget
- housing costs
- healthcare assumptions
- income structure
- future sovereign residency scenarios


Shall we?



**You** *(on Jun 15, 05:26 AM)*:

My place in pv is expensive for pv but still 60% of what I pay in chicago



**ChatGPT** *(on Jun 15, 05:26 AM)*:

Exactly — and what you're feeling there is very real and quite typical for income-sovereign expats:


> 
> You're already at 60% of Chicago cost even while renting at the high end of PV’s rental market.
> 


Let’s call that what it is:
**You're buying comfort, safety, location, and quality of life — and still saving massively vs Chicago.**



### This tells us a few important things:


- You are not yet maximizing the potential savings PV offers (you could live much cheaper if you wanted),
- But you're still getting the cost advantage while preserving your standard of living,
- And your quality of life relative to cost is probably far higher than in Chicago, even at your current PV rent.



### Now frame it against Toronto:


If you were to get comparable quality in Toronto (safe neighborhood, nice condo or townhome, walkable, good amenities), you’d likely be paying:
- **Toronto CAD $3500–5000/month** (for that high-end comfort zone).
- Which is **~$2500–3600 USD/month** just for housing.
- Plus much higher ongoing costs on everything else: groceries, transportation, taxes.


Even your “expensive for PV” rent is almost certainly still lower than equivalent housing in Toronto. And you avoid Canada's much higher tax and cost structure.



**Bottom line:**


> 
> You’ve already proven the thesis. PV gives you >40% better cost-performance even before optimizing.
> If you stay longer-term and get into ownership or longer-term rental structures, the gap widens even more.
> 



👉 If you want, I can model your *sovereign cost stack* for:
- PV (current & future ownership scenario)
- Chicago (current)
- Toronto (hypothetical)


Very simple, very real numbers.


Shall I run it?

Give me to vs pv



**ChatGPT** *(on Jun 15, 05:28 AM)*:

Perfect — let’s do a very simple **Toronto vs PV head-to-head** based on *comparable quality of life*.



## 🔧 Assumptions


(for a person like you — income-sovereign, living well but not stupidly extravagant):


| Category | PV (USD) | Toronto (USD equiv) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rent (high-end rental) | $2500 | $3200 (approx. CAD $4400) |
| Utilities (incl. internet) | $150 | $250 |
| Groceries | $500 | $800 |
| Dining out / coffee / lifestyle | $600 | $1000 |
| Healthcare (private pay in PV, public in Canada but supplementals) | $400 | $200 |
| Transportation (mostly walkable, occasional car) | $150 | $400 |
| Travel / flights home / misc expat costs | $300 | $100 |
| Taxes | Minimal | Significantly higher (depends on income)* |


* For now, I’ll exclude income tax since you’re income-sovereign. But this is a major lever if you fully relocate.



## 🔢 Monthly Total:


| City | Monthly Cost |
| --- | --- |
| PV | ~$4600 |
| Toronto | ~$5950 |



## 🔢 Annual Total:


| City | Annual Cost |
| --- | --- |
| PV | ~$55,200 |
| Toronto | ~$71,400 |



## 🔎 Differential:


> 
> You're looking at about $16K/year savings for very comparable comfort — and that's before tax impacts.
> 


If we fully load income tax (assuming Canadian residency and income taxation), the delta gets even larger.



## 🔮 The deeper truth:


- The gap is smaller than Chicago vs PV.
- But PV still offers a material advantage.
- The more you optimize long-term PV costs (buying property, Mexican residency, insurance shifts), the wider the gap becomes.
- Canada adds friction: tax exposure, cold weather, higher systemic costs.



👉 **One sentence summary:**


> 
> PV gives you ~20–25% better cost efficiency at equivalent comfort levels vs Toronto — and more degrees of sovereignty, flexibility, and personal agency.
> 



If you want, I can now model:
- ownership scenarios
- tax loaded scenarios
- long-term sovereign scenarios


**Shall I?** (this is where it gets very real)



**You** *(on Jun 15, 05:29 AM)*:

Fewer cartels



**ChatGPT** *(on Jun 15, 05:29 AM)*:

**Yes.**


That’s the honest rub.


Toronto:
- Essentially zero cartel violence risk.
- Rule of law mostly holds.
- Civil infrastructure, police, judiciary, institutions largely functional.


PV:
- Cartel presence is absolutely real — but generally operates under an informal *don’t touch the tourists / expat zones* understanding.
- Violence tends to be localized, targeted, and rarely touches foreign residents in PV itself.
- But: you're still inside a system where cartel power exists as part of the political and economic fabric.
- You’re exposed to a form of underlying instability that Canada largely does not have.



### The trade:


| PV | Toronto |
| --- | --- |
| Cheaper | More stable |
| More personal agency | Stronger systemic institutions |
| Flexible sovereign play | Very high-functioning social safety net |
| Political risk | Minimal political risk |
| Informal power structures | Formal, transparent rule of law |
| Lower taxes | Higher taxes |



So yes — **PV wins on lifestyle-per-dollar. Toronto wins on institutional safety.**


The question becomes:


> 
> Which risk stack feels more aligned with your sovereign path?
> 


You’ve already done a lot of deep work here.
If you want, I can help you map your "sovereign risk map" to make this even more precise.


Shall we build that?
