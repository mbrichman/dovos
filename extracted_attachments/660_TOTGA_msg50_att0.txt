The Empire Has No Clothes

I was born in Canada in 1968. Six months after the Summer of Love. In the depths of the Vietnam war. I still have a very early memory of seeing the war on television — the troops, the flag-draped coffins.

I never bought into the American dream. Not the one of hot dogs and apple pie—the idea that anyone can make it in America, but the myth of America. That it was a force for good in the world. A superpower on the side of light. A "shining city on the hill." That version of America never existed. 

Nearing sixty years after my birth, that fantasy is cracking in real time. The emperor has no clothes. And now, the empire itself stands exposed. Naked.

I was protesting outside the U.S. consulate in Toronto before many people reading this were born. Standing outside  the gray, almost Soviet-looking building on University Avenue in 1990 holding a sign that read “No Blood for Oil." I protested not because I hated America, but because I saw what others wouldn’t admit: that its power was always masking a deep hypocrisy. That its promises of freedom and prosperity were often delivered through coups, cartels and craven capitalists. Even the so-called American Dream, was never realized by the ordinary people who dreamt it.

What Came After the Myth

The Marshall Plan was America’s finest hour. An unprecedented act of generosity following the greatest self-inflicted cataclysm humanity had faced to date. It was also the last time America led with grace instead of power. The Cold War that followed wasn’t altruism—it was ideology. Containment. Coercion. Control. The United States stood for democracy when it aligned with anti-communism, and discarded it when it didn’t.

Yes, Western Europe was rebuilt. Yes, NATO provided security. But the cost for that benevolence? In Southern Europe, America supported fascists and dictators. In Eastern Europe, it made promises it never intended to keep. In Latin America, Africa, and Asia, it treated every legitimate exercise of self-determination, as an exercise of Soviet control within its "sphere of influence".

What followed the Marshall Plan wasn’t greatness—it was a half-century of imperialism disguised as moral leadership.

Korea: A war that never ended. Left in stalemate and permanent division.

Vietnam: Millions dead. Napalm. Agent Orange. A generation in the US and in Vietnam permanently traumatized.

Iran: The Shah installed by the CIA. Ultimately leading to revolution and theocratic rule. Turning back the clock on an emerging modern and intellectual nation.

Chile - CIA-backed coup overthrew democratically elected president Salvador Allende, installing Pinochet’s brutal dictatorship. Kissinger famously stating: "I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people. The issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves."

Central America: Death squads, Iran/Contra, genocide by proxy.

Afghanistan: Armed the mujahideen. Sowed the seeds of the Taliban.

Iraq War I: Sanctions that starved a generation. For oil.

9/11: Blowback from decades of intervention and proved to be an inflection point for the US and the world.

Iraq War II: A trillion-dollar lie.

The Great Recession: Late-stage capitalism at its finest. A check written by the elites, bounced by the system they built. The poor left bankrupt. And those who wrote the bad check? Never held to account. Not. One. Person.

And what did Americans reap from these seeds that the nation sowed? Stagflation, oil shocks, recession, savings and loan crises, towers of finance left in smoking ruin. And its people? Jobs outsourced for efficiency. Cities and towns decimated. Ways of life that lasted for generations, destroyed.

Thanks, America, for being great.

Let’s stop pretending this was ever about democracy.

Manifest Destiny was never destiny. It was a justification—for genocide, for slavery, for resource extraction, for money for money’s sake. For treating the rest of the world as a stage for American projection. As Bruce Cockburn famously sang, “modern slavers in drag as champions of freedom". These champions gave us the Trail of Tears, Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib and on the one month anniversary of my birth, the My Lai massacre. This ideology has now given us tech robber barons who fantasize about space colonies while their workers pee in bottles.

That’s not destiny. That’s pathology.

The Original Sin

It’s common among progressives to name slavery as America’s original sin. But I believe the rot goes deeper.

The true original sin was the Revolution itself—the moment the country enshrined violence as the chief engine of transformation. Not as a necessary evil, but as virtue.

The American Revolution wasn’t a desperate uprising of the oppressed. It wasn’t peasants storming the palace of an indifferent monarch. It wasn’t liberté, égalité, fraternité. It was a revolt of the empowered. Slaveholders, landowners, merchants—men who already had wealth and status and wanted to sever the ties that restrained them. What they resisted wasn’t tyranny. It was taxes.

The French Revolution  in contrast, was an eruption of desperation—from the bottom. Starving peasants and overburdened workers demanded bread, justice, and dignity. It was messy, bloody, and flawed, but born of necessity.

The American Revolution was born of impatience and entitlement. And from that genesis, emerged a political ideology that has shaped the country ever since:

That violence is how change happens.

That might makes right.

That righteousness is proved by victory.

That liberty belongs to those with the power to seize it—and keep it.

Slavery didn’t betray the ideals of the Revolution. It fulfilled them. So did westward expansion, Indigenous genocide, manifest destiny, and military imperialism. These weren’t aberrations. They were the logical extensions of a founding myth that made violence holy.

The “rocket’s red glare” and “bombs bursting in air” aren’t just in the national anthem, they are the national anthem.

It didn’t have to be this way.

Canada, the country where I was born, chose a different path. We had no revolution. No civil war. Our progress came slowly, often too slowly—but it came through negotiation and reform, not rupture. We abolished slavery without firing a shot. We built universal healthcare without toppling a government. Our constitution promised  peace, order, and good government and, despite its flaws, has largely delivered.

Canada is far from perfect, but it never built a national identity on the deification of violence. That makes a difference. Its colonial legacy is real and unresolved. Its crimes against its indigenous people were heinous. However, Canada has worked to reconcile and apologize for its past actions. 

America didn’t have to choose cannonballs over compromise, but it did.

Joining the Empire

I became an American citizen in 2018. Not because I bought into the myth — but because after 22 years of living in the country, I could no longer sit idle. I wanted my voice to be heard, to stand up, to say I dissent. To strengthen the ideal that we should always strive to build a more perfect union. I didn’t take that oath lightly. I swore it knowing the full weight of the nation’s contradictions — the promises broken, the violence sanctified, reparations still unpaid.

To dissent from within is an act of hope. But hope requires truth.

And the truth is: the empire has no clothes.

Chile 1973 = United States 2025?

I was at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago in 2020. I walked past photos of the disappeared, the echoes of protest songs, acting as a witness to the brutal oppression foisted upon a formerly free society. It was a shrine to a stolen democracy. And somewhere between the bullet-ridden banners and the rows of faces who never came home, it hit me:

This could well be America’s future.

The most chilling moment came as I read about the referendum Pinochet was eventually forced to hold. After seventeen years of dictatorship—after all the blood and terror—42% of Chileans still voted to maintain the regime.

Once America installed Pinochets in other countries. Now we elect our own.

After the Fire

America has never reckoned with its own imperialist and militaristic past. Instead violence has been enshrined in the constitution, strengthened by the Supreme Court, branded and glorified. Unlike Germany and Japan post World War II, the US war machine was never dismantled. It was gift-wrapped as freedom and forced upon the rest of the world.

Germany lost a war and became a powerhouse. Japan lost a war and found its soul.

America won, and lost its way.

Nuremberg will come. A reckoning will come. Eventually.
And when it does, let it be said: I was here. I bore witness. I dissented.
