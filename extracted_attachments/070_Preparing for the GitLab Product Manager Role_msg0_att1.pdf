Enable teams to effectively plan and execute work in a single application
As GitLab pursues its vision of replacing disparate DevSecOps toolchains with a single application, the Plan stage aspires to
build robust planning tools that tie directly into the broader DevSecOps lifecycle. Our goal is to empower teams to
continuously deliver customer and business value with the shortest possible cycle times.

Stage Overview
The Plan Stage provides tools for teams to manage and optimize their work, track operational health and measure
outcomes. As an end-to-end DevSecOps platform, GitLab is uniquely positioned to deliver a planning suite that enables
business leaders to drive their vision and DevSecOps teams to deliver value while improving how they work. The
unification of the DevSecOps process allows GitLab to interlink data across every stage of development, from ideation to
value delivered to customers.
Group and Categories
The Plan Stage is made up of four groups supporting all major categories needed to plan work for DevOps organizations,
including:
The Project Management group focuses on the needs of individual engineering teams to plan their work. Core
features include Issues, Work Items and Iterations to help teams plan, track, triage, and complete their work.
The Product Planning group focuses on connecting the work that engineering teams perform to higher level strategy,
across multiple teams and in longer time horizons (quarters or years). Core features include Epics and Roadmaps.
The Knowledge group focuses on enabling users to create, share, use and manage the knowledge and information of
an organization. Core features include the Content Editor, Pages and Wiki.
The Optimize group focuses on enabling organizations to uncover opportunities to continuously improve upon their
software development lifecycle. Core features include Value Stream Management and DORA metrics.

3 Year Stage Themes
Enterprise planning frameworks support
As examples, GitLab will provide:
Out of the box functionality that allows DevSecOps teams to follow Scrum, Kanban, and Requirements-based
development processes.
Work Items that represent discrete units of work and are typically used by single teams. Today we use Issues to
represent work but we plan to standardize on an underlying common model and introduce more work item
types. Examples of team work items types are Stories, Bugs, and Requirements.
Views to facilitate Plan workflows for personas that work in a single team, like Engineers, UX, Product, and
Engineering Managers. Example workflows are iteration planning, status views for a single team, and
retrospectives.
Out of the box functionality that aligns to industry-standard program and portfolio management, including
frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, and Disciplined Agile.
Work Items that represent collections of units of work and are typically used by multiple teams. Today we use
Epics to represent collections of units of work but we plan to standardize on an underlying common model and
introduce additional portfolio level work item types. Examples of portfolio level work item types are Features,
Epics, Themes, and OKRs.
Views to facilitate Plan workflows for personas that work across teams, like Program Managers, Managers of
Managers, and Executives. The ability to relate and roll up work items across projects and groups will be critical
for these personas. Example workflows are quarterly or program increment planning, status reporting across
multiple teams, and retrospectives across multiple teams.
Options to customize the data captured about work items and their status. We currently rely on labels for this
information, but our customers have expressed the need for a more structured approach. A lightweight custom data
solution in GitLab has the ability to enable a wide range of use cases such as prioritization models and CapEx
reporting.
Our approach to configuration
Our vision is to build a Plan experience that aligns with our configuration principles. When you look across the Enterprise
Agile Planning tool landscape, you'll find solutions with large customer bases that cover many methodologies and
personas. Our competitors have built highly flexible solutions with many customization options to accommodate the large
array of use cases. Unfortunately, this makes these tools non-performant and challenging to administer, leading to
customer dissatisfaction.
We have strong signals from our customers that they want a planning tool that supports their processes but is not
overbearing. Recent conversations include:
An industry leading telecommunications company that wants to consolidate multiple planning tools into GitLab.
Their current setup has complicated enforced workflows and data integrations that make their tools difficult to use.
A bank that is migrating their teams to GitLab, leaving behind their current highly customized planning tool. Our plan
capabilities are lighter weight, increase developer productivity, and encourage collaboration.
A manufacturing company that values team automony and collaboration. They are moving to GitLab to reduce
context switching with separate development and planning tools and to improve cross-team planning workflows.
There are now countless solutions that aim to make planning tools that teams love. For example, tools like Notion,
Monday.com, and Asana simplify configuration and focus on user experience. Embracing a comparable philosophy, our
approach will distinguish itself through a tailored experience driven by our platform strategy. Our focus is empowering
DevSecOps organizations to enhance their agile fluency by seamlessly integrating workflows throughout the DevSecOps
lifecycle.
We have heard the feedback that, while we should stay true to our principle of convention over configuration, GitLab
should enable configuration options that allow organizations to accurately represent their way of working. Introducing
additional configuration options will also allow us to create an experience that works by default, instead of heavily relying
on label configuration. To address this feedback, we plan to introduce the features below:
Custom fields - Labels are not flexible enough to efficiently or accurately represent all the different data types that
organizations need to track within GitLab. Custom fields will offer a structured way to capture and report on business
critical metadata that is specific to an organization or team.
Configurable statuses - Today, work items can be open or closed which is not granular enough to communicate or
produce reports based on where work is in the lifecycle.
Work Item Types - Instead of relying solely on labels to classify work items, you will be able to define the types of
work items. Using work item types will enable more robust analytics into the health of your value stream.
Automation rules - Relying on automation streamlines processes and reduces human error more effectively than
configuring complex status workflows in agile planning tools, enhancing efficiency and ensuring consistent
performance. We will prioritize automation over intricate status workflows to satisfy requirements for work items to
follow a specific workflow path.
GitLab will continue to put the user at the forefront, while further enabling organizations to satisfy their planning
requirements through:
1. Streamlined configuration: We will prioritize simplicity by minimizing configuration options while always providing
sensible defaults. This approach avoids the confusion and inconsistency often associated with overly customizable
tools, ensuring a smoother experience for end users. Examples of overly complex configuration are defining a field as
mandatory once a work item reaches a certains status or only allowing certain fields to be only edited by specific
users.
2. Uninterrupted workflows: Embracing Agile principles, we will steer clear of imposing rigid toll gates or checkpoints
that hinder progress. By fostering flexibility and continuous delivery, we empower teams to respond swiftly to
changes and deliver value incrementally, without unnecessary bureaucracy.
3. Empowering autonomy: Balancing governance and autonomy, we will offer organization and team-level
management options. Our cascading configuration model will allow for flexibility, enabling groups to define and
refine processes while ensuring compliance where needed. Administrators can choose to empower sub-groups and
projects with additional configuration options to suit their unique needs without risking disorganized sprawl.
Duo Pro and Enterprise usage metrics
The Optimize team is focusing on iterating on AI Impact Analytics to surface usage and value metrics for customers
adopting Duo Pro and Duo Enterprise. While there are several avenues we could explore for AI Impact Analytics, it's
important to distinguish what we are incorporating into our scope and what we are not. Items in scope represent those
things for which Optimize is the DRI. Items not in scope fall outside of the domain and ownership of Optimize.
In scope:
Metrics that help a single customer gain insights into the value and ROI for using Duo.
This focus is primarily on quantifying productivity gains, business outcomes, and Duo adoption for individual
customers.
AI Impact Analytics dashboards built in alignment with the vision of a platform-level dashboarding framework.
Tiering strategy for AI Impact Analytics for Duo Pro and Duo Enterprise.
Per-user adoption of Duo Enterprise features within the context of a single customer.
Not in scope:
Utilization metrics that span across the fleet of instances and customers communicating with the AI Gateway.
Utilization metrics intended for internal audiences such as those captured via product telemetry and visualized in
Tableau.
Functionality and maintenance of existing and future Duo unit primitives outside of those where Optimize is the DRI.
Duo license provisioning and management, including field support where customers encounter challenges with
license management.
Adding support for ClickHouse to GitLab Dedicated.
Instrumenting Duo metrics for other teams. The DRI for a Duo unit primitive is responsible for instrumenting their
own metrics.
Duo usage data specifically related to fulfillment use cases.
Use DevSecOps data to optimize planning
As an end-to-end DevSecOps platform, GitLab is uniquely positioned to deliver a planning suite that enables business
leaders to drive their vision and empower their development teams to work efficiently. Our unification of the DevSecOps
process allows us to interlink data across every stage of development, from initial analysis to planning, implementation,
deployment, and monitoring. Today, few teams can answer how long their software projects take, and even fewer can
answer how long each stage in the process takes. Without this information, most teams are flying blind on their estimates,
using past experiences and best guesses to best calculate the time or level of effort that it will take to get from an idea to
production. Engineering and product managers need to parse through information in multiple systems to know if problems
will keep their teams from meeting their plans. The data is often hard to understand, so engineers' days are interrupted
with requests for status updates. Executives rely on status reports that are created manually and often inaccurate. To fully
solve this problem, DevSecOps data should be displayed so that it's easy to understand for users that are not developers.
As examples, GitLab will:
Roll-up reports and dashboarding that provide visibility into where to focus next on improving performance and
reliability includes:
Value stream dashboard to allow all stakeholders, from executives to individual contributors, to have visibility
in the process and value delivery metrics associated with the software development life cycle. The Value
stream dashboard enables teams to continuously improve workflows by benchmarking key DevSecOps metrics
and comparing these metrics over time to identify and fix engineering inefficiencies and bottlenecks.
Everyday analytics for teams: Increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of everyday software development
teams — surfacing actionable insights, identifying bottlenecks, and highlighting waste.
Leverage data from other DevSecOps stages to provide context to non-technical users in work items; enabling them
to derive the current status of work.
Flag work items that are at risk during an iteration based on DORA key metrics and Value Stream Analytics.
Incorporate data from DORA key metrics and Value Stream Analytics into retrospective workflows.
Automation, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to improve quality of
life
Managing issues across an organization can be a time-consuming and tedious endeavor. It's normal for organizations to
have a large number of stale issues that require manual clean-up. Our focus will be to let automation do the lower value
work like managing status changes and automating the movement of work items among workstations (queues) so the
people doing the work can focus more on creating value and less on remembering the process. At GitLab, we dogfood our
issue tracker and have implemented a considerable amount of automation to start down this direction. We will double
down on this strategy, incorporate automation into our product and reduce the manual setup required to enable it. GitLab
can also provide suggestions and nudges that reduce the number of actions required to complete common tasks.
GitLab has recently created AI-powered stage and the Plan Stage has been collabrating with that stage to bring new AI-
powered Planning capabilities.
As examples, GitLab will provide:
Assistance in generating text for work items like issues and epics.
Auto-assign issues based on previous assignments.
Auto-close or suggest closing issues if downstream activity implies it.
Apply labels automatically based on historical issue data.
Change issue health if downstream DevSecOps activity implies it.
Surface, categorize and rank work items that may need a user's attention.
Optimize everyday manual actions like work item data entry or updates by providing real-time suggestions.
3 Year Strategy
In three years, the Plan Stage market will:
Continue to shift from project to product and focus on outcomes instead of output.
Continue to move away from command and control mentality and instead empower teams to determine how they
can contribute toward business objectives.
Make operational efficiency and continual improvement a top priority.
Embrace AI within the Plan stage of the DevSecOps toolchain and lifecycle.
Shift toward consolidation into a single platform for all stages of the DevSecOps lifecycle.
As a result, in three years, Gitlab will:
Provide support for individual DevSecOps teams and entire organizations, keeping Agile frameworks in mind.
Allow GitLab to capture and tie metrics to Work Items to reflect business outcomes.
Surface metrics like DORA, Flow and Value Stream in key parts of a teams workflow to help drive improvements.
Support frameworks like OKRs that encourage bottom-up contributions.
Use downstream DevSecOps data for automation and AI to help teams improve their plans.
Make it easy for non-Developer Personas to contribute in GitLab.
1 Year Plan
What We Recently Completed
Adds type attribute to issues webhook payloads (17.1) – Issues, tasks, incidents, requirements, objectives, and key
results all trigger payloads under the Issues Events webhook category. Until now, there has been no way to quickly
determine the type of object that triggered the webhook within the event payload. This release introduces an
object_attributes.type attribute available on payloads within the Issues events, Comments, Confidential issues
events, and Emoji events triggers.
Resolve threads in tasks, objectives, and key results (17.3) – You can now resolve threads in tasks, objectives, and key
results, making it easier to manage and track important conversations. Resolved threads are collapsed by default,
helping you focus on active discussions and streamline your collaboration workflows.
Add Merge Requests to Tasks (17.3) – When referencing a task from within an MR description using the closing
pattern, Merge Requests will now be linked to the task, providing better visibility and traceability between tasks and
related code changes. This feature enhances project management by allowing teams to easily track which merge
requests are associated with specific tasks, improving workflow and collaboration.
Summarize Issue discussions GA (17.4) – View an AI generated summary of all threads and comments within an issue
or epic to quickly get up to spead on the discussion.
Improvements to the rich text editor - Following the initial rollout in GitLab 16.2, we continue to make improvements
to the rich text editor. In 17.1, we introduced draggable media in the rich text editor and downscaling pasted images.
Real-time boards (17.1) - Changes you make in the sidebar will instantly appear on the board itself, no more
refreshing required. This reactive boards experience streamlines your workflow, allowing you to quickly make
updates while seeing them reflected in real-time.
Adds type attribute to issues webhook payloads (17.1) – Issues, tasks, incidents, requirements, objectives, and key
results all trigger payloads under the Issues Events webhook category. Until now, there has been no way to quickly
determine the type of object that triggered the webhook within the event payload. This release introduces an
object_attributes.type attribute available on payloads within the Issues events, Comments, Confidential issues
events, and Emoji events triggers.
Resolve threads in tasks, objectives, and key results (17.3) – You can now resolve threads in tasks, objectives, and key
results, making it easier to manage and track important conversations. Resolved threads are collapsed by default,
helping you focus on active discussions and streamline your collaboration workflows.
Add Merge Requests to Tasks (17.3) – When referencing a task from within an MR description using the closing
pattern, Merge Requests will now be linked to the task, providing better visibility and traceability between tasks and
related code changes. This feature enhances project management by allowing teams to easily track which merge
requests are associated with specific tasks, improving workflow and collaboration.
Summarize Issue discussions GA (17.4) – View an AI generated summary of all threads and comments within an issue
or epic to quickly get up to spead on the discussion.
New event into Value Stream Analytics (VSA) was added - "Merge request last approved at" to improve development
workflow tracking. This enhancing workflow visibility with new insights into merge request review time.
New API with code suggestion usage events (17.5). Thjis API provide the raw event data and designed for customers
without ClickHouse to gain insights into AI usage.
Value Stream Management report generator tool (17.1) – With the addition of the new Reports Generation Tool for
Value Stream Management, we empower decision-makers to be more efficient and effective in the software
development life cycle (SDLC) optimization. You can now schedule DevSecOps comparison metrics reports or the AI
Impact analytics report to be delivered automatically, proactively, and with relevant information in GitLab issues.
With scheduled reports, managers can focus on analyzing insights and making informed decisions, rather than
spending time manually searching for the right dashboard with the required data. You can access the scheduled
reports tool using the CI/CD Catalog.
Adding a new event "MR first reviewer assigned" (17.2) – To improve the tracking of development workflows in
GitLab, we added the Value Stream Analytics has been extended with a new stage event: "MR first reviewer assigned".
**AI Impact analytics: Code Suggestions acceptance rate and GitLab Duo seats usage (17.3) – These two new metrics
highlight the effectiveness and utilization of GitLab Duo, and are now included in the AI Impact analytics in the Value
Streams Dashboard, which helps organizations understand the impact of GitLab Duo on delivering business value.
AI Impact analytics with enhanced sparklines trend visualization (17.3) – We are excited to announce a significant
improvement to our AI Impact analytics with the introduction of sparklines. These small, simple graphs embedded in
data tables enhance the readability and accessibility of AI Impact data. By transforming numerical values into visual
representations, the new sparklines make it easier to identify trends over time, so you can spot upward or downward
movements. This new visual approach also streamlines the process of comparing trends across multiple metrics,
reducing the time and effort required when relying solely on numbers.
New Value Stream Analytics stage events for Cycle Time Reduction (17.3) – To improve the tracking of merge request
(MR) review time in GitLab, we added a new stage event to Value Stream Analytics: MR first reviewer assigned. With
this new event teams can identify where delays occur in the review process, find opportunities to improve
collaboration, and encourage a culture of responsiveness and accountability among team members. Reducing the
review time directly impacts the overall cycle time of development, leading to faster software delivery. For example,
you can now add a new custom Review Time to Merge (RTTM) stage that starts with MR first reviewer assigned and
ends with MR merged.
Export code suggestions usage events (17.5) – Previously, AI impact analytics were available only on GitLab.com to
GitLab Duo Enterprise customers, and on GitLab self-managed with a ClickHouse integration. Additionally, the
default metrics were aggregated. Now, you can export raw code suggestion events from the GraphQL API. This way
you can import the data into your data analysis tool to get deeper insights into acceptance rates across more
dimensions, such as suggestion size, language, and user. The raw events are not stored in ClickHouse, so some AI
Impact Analytics metrics become available to all GitLab deployments, including GitLab Dedicated and self-managed.
Value Stream Management & DORA report generator tool (17.1) – With the addition of the new Reports Generation Tool for
Value Stream Management & DORA, we empower decision-makers to be more efficient and effective in the software
development life cycle (SDLC) optimization. You can now schedule DORA comparison metrics reports or the AI Impact
analytics report to be delivered automatically, proactively, and with relevant information in GitLab issues. With scheduled
reports, managers can focus on analyzing insights and making informed decisions, rather than spending time manually
searching for the right dashboard with the required data. You can access the scheduled reports tool using the CI/CD
Catalog.
What We Are Currently Working On
Migrating epics to the work items framework will allow us to eventually bring more consistency with issues and
address long-standing requests, like assignees on epics.
Wiki Connectivity - Allow users to connect their Wiki knowledge base with the rest of the DevSecOps lifecycle.
Pages Multi-Version Support - Currently a project can have only a single version of a GitLab Pages site. This make it
hard for customers to try new ideas on their sites without changing the only version of the site. Customers need a
way to preview changes or have multiple environments for their GitLab Pages sites to make it possible to validate
changes before deploying their site.
Work Item Enhancements – Standardize the workflow for creating planning objects and associate DevSecOps
artifacts to supported work item types.
Add support for custom fields to work items. Provide teams with a more robust solution for associating business-
specific meta-data to work items. We're starting with adding support for basic custom fields, which will be
configurable within root groups.
Enable work items (Tasks) to be visible on Boards. Teams can manage their tasks (and other work items) from within
Boards.
Complete the migration of issues to work items. Replace the legacy issue detail view with the new and improved real-
time work item detail view.
Improved "AI Impact" analytics to the Value Stream Dashboard, to provide more holistic view of the ROI from the
investments in AI features. We're currently focusing on adding per-user metrics, making basic AI Impact Analytics
available for Duo Pro customers via the GraphQL API, and making iterative improvements to the data visualization
and user experience on the AI Impact Analytics dashboard.
Enhanced configuration for custom value stream analytics reports - With this change, custom VSA report stage
configuration moves from a modal to a standalone page and adds support for persistent filters that apply to all items
included in the custom VSA report.
DORA Performers project comparison — In a previous release, we added a visualization to show the number of
projects performing on a low/medium/high scale for the primary DORA metrics. In this release, we will expand the
performers table to include a project-level breakdown of DORA metrics to quickly understand which projects are
performing compared to those not.
What's Next For Us
Over the next year, we are focused on the following:
Group issues. Issues can be created within groups without depending on a project within the group. This will
optionally allow teams to consolidate their planning workflows within a single location instead of spreading them
across a group and a project.
Work items open in a drawer within boards and lists. Reduce the context switching and tab fatique when drilling
down into a work item detail view.
Customizable work item statuses. Provide a foundation for building a more robust work item lifecycle management
solution, and enable teams to mark work items as done or cancelled.
Report on iteration velocity and volatility – Helps teams have meaningful discussions about trade-offs and
estimations when planning upcoming iterations. Issues and tasks can be assigned to iterations, so our next step is
showing parent/child relationships in the iteration report, followed by displaying velocity and volatility.
Work items are natively supported within Groups – Eliminate the need to maintain projects under groups solely for
agile planning purposes, allow teams to consolidate their planning activities at the group level, and enable issues
and epics to be migrated to work items. We're currently working on the remaining blockers to feature parity between
legacy issues and work item issues. Once issues are migrated to work items, we will be able to turn on native Group
Issues.
Surface additional AI Impact Analytics metrics to help customers better understand the impact and ROI for
using GitLab Duo Pro and Duo Enterpise – In addition to metrics for code suggestions and chat, we will provide
insight into productivity gains from:
Adoption of pipeline root cause analysis.
Adoption of vulnerability explanation/resolution.
Adding AI vs. Non-AI Cohort Analysis.
Adding insight into "language usage" of Code Suggestions.
Working on an update UX vision for AI adoption dashboard.
Mature Value Streams Dashboard for Executives to enable decision-makers to identify trends, patterns, and
opportunities for digital transformation improvements.In the next 1-3 milestones, we will focus on the following:
Consolidate Group::Optimize dashboards into the Cross-stage Dashboards framework. With the new
framework, customers can visualize their DevSecOps data using built-in dashboards provided by GitLab or by
creating custom dashboards with custom visualizations.
Customizable widgets to show data that is relevant to user's goals and needs. Adding the "Platform Insights"
customizable UI capabilities. Integrate the Value streams dashboard page into the Platform Insights schema
driven UI.
Adding VSA settings with label filters configuration. In a similar way to boards, teams want to use saved filtered labels
with value streams.
Moving DORA charts from the CI/CD Analytics into the new dashboarding framework
Add a new Dashboard for Executive to enable decision-makers to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for
digital transformation improvements. In the next phases, we will focus on the following:
Adding a new DORA Metrics Overview page in the Value Stream Dashboard. This is related to
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/453958.
Adding a new DORA Metrics Analytics page in the Value Stream Dashboard. This is related to
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/453958.
Adding Custom Metrics Calculation Rules for DORA, to support multiple environment branches (with GitLab
flow), and improve the metric calculation to effectively track incidents and deployments.
Move DORA metrics to ClickHouse to provide best experience and robust indicators for measuring the metrics.
Adding the Fifth DORA Metric - Reliability - Operational performance
Enhancing our ability to visualize data by providing a singular hub for accessing and presenting information,
adaptable to different visualization preferences.
Maturing our Wiki to satisfy more jobs to be done.
What We're Not Doing
GitLab will not provide extensive configuration options that complicate collaboration and increase the maintenance
burden. Examples are:
Blocking users from editing work items due to field-level configuration.
Creation of state workflows with transition rules.
Configuring screen field layouts.
Plan functionality will be generic enough to allow its use by many personas and use cases. However, we will focus on
optimizing for use cases for DevSecOps workflows in the immediate future. Our long-term vision is to become the
system of record for planning across any function, but we are starting with DevSecOps teams as our target. Example
use cases that we are not focused on include:
Marketing
HR
Legal
Service Desk
In order to meet the vision described in this page, we will decrease investment in our Requirements Management,
Test Management, DevOps Reports, Design Management and Time Tracking categories. We will continue to address
defects and support community contributions but we are not planning to make significant improvements.
Cross-Stage Initiatives
Plan offers functionality that ties into workflows in other stages. We are actively collaborating with other stages that are
building upon Plan functionality to meet their users needs.
The Manage:Import and Integrate group has built a Jira integration that displays Jira Issue data within GitLab. We will
collaborate with that team to tie Jira Issues into more workflows like reporting and tying Jira Issues to higher level
work items.
The Manage:Import and Integrate owns the Jira importer to allow Jira issues to be migrated to GitLab. We will
continue to work with that team to extend GitLab work items to accomodate more critical data elements from Jira to
ensure a seamless import process.
The Plan stage and the Service Desk Single Engineer Group are collaborating on accelerating Service Desk, which will
extend work items to support adjacent use cases to portfolio and team planning.
Plan:Optimize is collaborating with Manage:organization to Consolidate Value Stream Analytics Group & Project into
a single object - Workspace.
Plan:Optimize is collaborating with Analytics:Product Analytics to consolidate standalone analytics pages and
reports to a platform-level dashboarding framework.
Plan:Optimize is collaborating with Govern:Threat Insights to add Vulnerabilities metrics to the Value Streams
Dashboard.
Plan:Optimize is collaborating with AI:Framework team to create an AI Impact Dashboard to better quantify the effect
of using AI on productivity.
Plan:Knowledge collaborates with Groups across all areas of GitLab to develop and improve upon the rich text editor.
The rich text editor is a what you see is what you get editing experience, and is an alternative to the plain text editor
which requires knowledge of markdown to leverage.
Plan:Project Management is collaborating with Deploy:Environments on a platform-level automation framework.
